# Tylers-Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio about projects I have created based front end developing and full stack developing and how to contact me as well as my personal resume.

- I made this to show all of my projects/ websites that I have created.
- On this portfolio I have added a sample of projects by clicking on the images it will launch you to that website.
- This helped me create a nice "rough draft" portfolio, with more experience coming in the next few months I will be able to have a more professional portfolio along with better developed websites.
- I learned how to build my very own code/website from scratch, it was quite difficult but exciting at the same time.
